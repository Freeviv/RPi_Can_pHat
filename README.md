# RPi Can pHat
A Raspberry Can pHat/Shield/Addon (Hat only if it has a eeprom memory installed into it). Based on the template from [xesscorp](https://github.com/xesscorp/RPi_Hat_Template).

The current version is 1.3.  
The first two where tests to verify the design (I messed up twice <.<). So if you want to use this design to make sure that you validate it for yourself. If you find something to improve please make sure to create an issue or pull request.
